# Dog Treat Dispenser

This project is designed to create a reliable single-treat dispenser for dogs, helping with crate training and automated positive reinforcement. Treats can be dispensed manually by pressing a button, or automatically using computer vision to detect when the dog is obeying a command.

## Motivation

A key challenge is dispensing just one treat at a time, without jamming or accidentally dropping extra treats. The current solution uses a hopper that delivers treats into a servo-actuated rotating drum. The drum has a dimple to capture a single treat; when activated, the servo rotates the drum, releasing one treat into a chute below.

## Features

- **Single treat dispensing** mechanism using a servo-driven rotating drum and hopper
- **Manual trigger**: Push-button dispensing
- **Automatic trigger**: Computer vision-based reward when your dog successfully follows a command

## Hardware & Tools

- **3D Modeling:** Tinkercad
- **3D Printing:** Bambu Lab A1
- **Electronics:** Arduino microcontroller

## Status

Work is continuing to perfect consistent single treat dispensing without jams or double-drops.
